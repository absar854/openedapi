OpenEd API
==========

OpenEd is the world's largest educational resource catalog, currently with over 250,000 videos, games and other resources.  It is the only site completely focused on aligning educational resources to standards.   

The OpenEd API lets you use the capabilities of the OpenEd engine for finding resources and providing information about educational standards (Common Core and otherwise) inside your own apps and websites.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the api.opened.io domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.  API calls which make changes require OAuth 2 authentication.

MANAGING RESOURCES
==================

OpenEd allows videos to be searchable with the following REST API, from any app, web or otherwise.


Resource Search
---------------

Find resources based on:

* descriptive - searches title, description, area_title and subject_title with Solr fulltext search
* standard_group_id - looks for resources aligned with specified standards are in the standard_group by standard_group.id
* category - looks for resources aligned with specified standards are in the category by category.id or category.title
* standard - looks for resources aligned with specified standard by standard.id (the internal object ID) or standard.identifier (the Common Core ID)
* area - looks for resources assigned with specified area (and/or with specified subjects of area) by area.id or area.title
* subject - looks for resources assigned with specified subject by subject.id or subject.title
* grade - restricts to specified grades (expressed as K,1, .. 12)
* ids - comma separated list of resource IDs (will skip all given filters)
* limit - resources to return, default to 50

For example:

` https://api.opened.io/resources.json?descriptive=Quadratic%20Equations&limit=3 `

will return a JSON object like the following

```json

```

As another example you can search for resources matching a specific standard or standards with the following:

` https://api.opened.io/resources.json?standard=K.CC.1&limit=3 `

will return

```json

```

You should use the share_url attribute as the URL to display to your users.   The underlying resource is safe_url, but it is (ironically) "unsafe" (the underlying resources can move).  If you use share_url OpenEd manages underlying URLs movements.

Add Resources to Catalog
------------------------
You can also add resources to the OpenEd catalog in bulk. This requires a list of URLs of existing resources, hosted somewhere.  

This call requires OAuth2 authentication.  
[Not implemented yet]

Upload Resource to Site
-----------------------
This uploads the actual resource binary itself to OpenEd.  We use YouTube to host videos.  We have our own server space for other resources.

This call requires OAuth2 authentication.  
[Not Implemented Yet]

MANAGING STANDARDS
==================

OpenEd also allows you to search for information on standards themselves (in addition to finding resources for standards).  Standards are organized into "standard groups" such as "Common Core Math" and "Common Core Language Arts".  Within a standard group there are "grade groups" such as "Elementary" and "Middle School".  Each grade group has a set of "categories" (sometimes known as "strands"), such as "Geometry". Within categories there are individual standards. This method of organizing standards was created by the Common Core State Standards, but we use it to structure all standard groups.  



Standard Groups
---------------
List all standard groups along with resource counts.  

For example:
` http://api.opened.io/standard_groups.json `

will return:

```json
{"standard_groups":[{"id":2,"name":"Common Core Language Arts","title":"Common Core Language Arts","count":3844},{"id":7,"name":"Common Core Literacy:History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects","title":"Common Core Literacy:History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects","count":206},{"id":4,"name":"Common Core Math","title":"Common Core Math","count":9072},{"id":9,"name":"National Geography Standards","title":"National Geography Standards","count":78},{"id":5,"name":"New York Common Core Social Studies","title":"New York Common Core Social Studies","count":880},{"id":6,"name":"Next Generation Science Standards","title":"Next Generation Science Standards","count":603},{"id":1,"name":"Social Studies (California History Standards)","title":"Social Studies (California History Standards)","count":984}]}
```

Grade Groups
------------
You can also list the grade groups that are available in a given standard group. It will the grade group along with the grades corresponding to that group.  For example:

` http://api.opened.io/grade_groups.json?standard_group=Common%20Core%20Math `

will return:

```json
{"grade_groups":[{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:05Z","display":"Elementary","gg_sort_key":1,"id":46,"ident":"K,1,2,3,4,5,6","name":"Elementary","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2013-10-11T17:57:04Z"}},{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:06Z","display":"Middle School","gg_sort_key":2,"id":47,"ident":"6,7,8,6-8","name":"Middle School","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2013-10-11T17:57:04Z"}},{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:22Z","display":"High School: Algebra","gg_sort_key":null,"id":49,"ident":"A","name":"High School: Algebra","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2012-12-09T17:15:29Z"}},{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:22Z","display":"High School: Functions","gg_sort_key":null,"id":50,"ident":"F","name":"High School: Functions","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2012-12-09T17:16:22Z"}},{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:22Z","display":"High School: Geometry","gg_sort_key":null,"id":51,"ident":"G","name":"High School: Geometry","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2012-12-09T17:16:12Z"}},{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:23Z","display":"High School: Number and Quantity","gg_sort_key":null,"id":52,"ident":"NQ","name":"High School: Number and Quantity","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2013-02-13T15:57:48Z"}},{"grade_groups":{"created_at":"2012-10-02T11:41:23Z","display":"High School: Statistics & Probability ","gg_sort_key":null,"id":53,"ident":"SP","name":"High School: Statistics & Probability ","standard_group_id":null,"updated_at":"2013-02-13T15:53:28Z"}}]}
```

Categories
----------
You can list the categories (also known as "strands") based on several criteria. It will also return a count of resources.  
* standard_group - shows all categories within a standard group
* grade_group - restricts the category to a grade group, such as Elementary (coming soon)

For example:

` http://api.opened.io/categories.json?standard_group=Common%20Core%20Math `

will return these categories:

```json
